  "product_sketch": "YGT is an emotionally intelligent AI companion that adapts to a user's mental and emotional state over time. It operates in four adaptive modes: Recovery, Stability, Growth, and Thriving. Each mode adjusts the assistant's tone, pacing, and types of support. YGT offers reflective prompts, daily check-ins, energy and mood pattern tracking, values-aligned nudges, and a sense of continuity via narrative memory. Its goal is to support users through burnout, help them stabilize, and guide them toward high-agency living â€” without triggering guilt, overwhelm, or shallow 'life hack' culture.",
