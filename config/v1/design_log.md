# Design Log - YGT

## Run: 2024-01-15 10:00:00

**Configuration:**

- **Version:** v1
- **Model:** gpt-4
- **Output Format:** markdown
- **Interview Modes:** 4
- **Total Interviews:** 7

**Modes & Persona Counts Executed:**

- **Recovery:** 2 personas, 2 hypotheses
- **Stability:** 2 personas, 1 hypotheses
- **Growth:** 2 personas, 1 hypotheses
- **Thriving:** 1 personas, 1 hypotheses

**Hypotheses Tested:**

- **Overwhelm Regulation:** People experiencing burnout or PTSD often struggle to regulate their emotional state in moments of overwhelm. We're testing whether a gentle, emotionally attuned AI assistant can help users co-regulate by offering validation, grounding, and safe next steps...
- **Trauma-Aware Productivity:** Many high-functioning trauma survivors want to stay productive, but traditional systems trigger shame or collapse. We're exploring whether a soft, non-judgmental assistant can help them structure their day without guilt or pressure...
- **Energy Awareness and Boundary Support:** Users in recovery often regain stability but struggle to maintain energy boundaries. We're testing whether lightweight daily reflection and gentle nudging can help them build sustainable capacity without backsliding...
- **Values-Based Growth Nudges:** Users ready to grow often lose traction when tools are too generic or push productivity over purpose. We're testing if a values-reflective companion can support intrinsic, sustainable growth...
- **Peak-State Reflection and Momentum:** Even high-performing users need intelligent reflection to maintain momentum. We're exploring whether a self-aware, hype-oriented AI can help them tune their energy and stay aligned with deeper goals...

**Product Sketch Critique:**

- Current sketch: YGT is an emotionally intelligent AI companion that adapts to a user's mental and emotional state over time. It operates in four adaptive modes: Recovery, Stability, Growth, and Thriving. Each mode adjusts the assistant's tone, pacing, and types of support. YGT offers reflective prompts, daily check-ins, energy and mood pattern tracking, values-aligned nudges, and a sense of continuity via narrative memory. Its goal is to support users through burnout, help them stabilize, and guide them toward high-agency living â€” without triggering guilt, overwhelm, or shallow 'life hack' culture...
- **Critique:** The current product sketch shows very low alignment (0% overall) across all modes and hypotheses. This suggests the product concept needs significant rethinking. The tone and approach may be too generic or not addressing the specific needs identified in the interviews.

**Recommendations for Next Version:**

- **Focus on Specific Pain Points:** The interviews revealed very specific pain points around imposter syndrome, boundary setting, and professional overwhelm. The next version should address these directly rather than offering generic emotional support.
- **Simplify the Mode System:** The four-mode system may be too complex. Consider focusing on one or two core use cases that showed the most potential.
- **Add Concrete Features:** The current sketch is too abstract. Add specific features like boundary-setting tools, imposter syndrome support, and professional overwhelm management.
- **Test with Different Personas:** The current personas may not represent the target audience well. Consider testing with different demographic and psychological profiles.
